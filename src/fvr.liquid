        <p>FORVR MOOD approached me with a design they needed implemented on a preexisting Shopify theme. They were anticipating a product re-launch in the near future and were particularly invested in a complete overhaul of their homepage. The design they had commissioned was highly technical, and would require many points of customization.</p>
        <p>Over the next month I built a development stack using Postcss + Tailwind and Github integration to bolster the development process. I worked directly with company leads to implement, and QA test the redeveloped site, for a successful launch in mid 2023.</p>
        <p>I have been continuing to work with FORVR MOOD to help them fully migrate away from their Shopify template theme, and into an entirely bespoke, custom developed theme.</p>
