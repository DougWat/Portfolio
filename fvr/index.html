        <p>FORVR MOOD approached me with a design they needed implemented on a preexisting Shopify theme. They were anticipating a product re-launch in the near future and were particularly invested in a complete overhaul of their homepage. The design they had commissioned was highly technical, and would require many points of customization.</p>
        <p>Over the next month I built a development stack using Postcss + Tailwind and Github integration to bolster the development process. I worked directly with company leads to implement, and QA test the redeveloped site, for a successful launch in mid 2023.</p>
        <p>I have been continuing to work with FORVR MOOD to help them fully migrate away from their Shopify template theme, and into an entirely bespoke, custom developed theme.</p>

        <h3 class="font-fvr text-center mb-12">A Homepage to Call Home</h3>
        <p>FORVR came to me with a limited web-budget; they were in the middle of a company wide transformation, and they wanted a website to reflect their re-branding. They had already worked with a designer, and had a full redesign ready to be built. Together, we desided I'd first focus my attention on the homepage. I wanted this homepage to be valuable for the client beyond this first launch, so it was essential that I developed it in such a way to allow FORVR to control every aspect of the product spread for this, and future product launches.</p>

            <h3 class="font-fvr">Dynamic Colors</h3>
            <p>Color is essential to FORVR's branding, and the client's control over these colors was essential. By changing a single variable in the Shopify customizer everything from the button highlight, to the SVG lines, to the background gradiant is updated seemlessly.</p>
